				<p id='churchparagraph1'>During the second half of my recent summer, I began working as a planning assistant, general <br>maintenance worker, and sunday school teacher at Toronto's largest United Church.</p>

				<p id='churchparagraph2'>I worked as a general maintenance worker for the first half of my work contract and as a planning <br> assistant the second half of the work contract. Maintenance consisted of large projects such as <br>  independently building an outdoor drainage system. Planning was done electronically using a <br>planning software that the church had installed on my laptop. I helped with room booking and <br> planning schedules.</p>

				<p id='churchparagraph3'>On Sundays I taught Sunday school to young children from the ages of 4-13.</p>

				<p id='alarmguardp1'>I spent a month learning sales techniques and improving my communication skills by going door to <br> door in Ajax hoping to sell quality alarm systems.</p>

				<p id='alarmguardp2'>At the end of June I quit my job with Alarmguard Sales because travelling to Ajax each day was <br>consuming much of my time. However, I truly valued how much I was able to improve my <br> interpersonal  and customer service skills through hands-on experience and/or by observing more <br> experienced sales workers. </p>

				<p>After returning from Waterloo, I was able to get a position with Hatch Canada as a child Javascript <br>Coach. Once/twice a week I would visit a school or the Hatch centre location downtown to guide <br> children in using the Hatch online platform to complete activities and learn how to use P5JS, a <br>library of Javascript.</p>

				<p id='hatchp2'>My contract with Hatch ended when the elementary school term ended, and I decided to apply to <br> new jobs to gain a wider variety of job experience. Hatch started my interest in coding and taught <br> me the basics. I really enjoyed working with the children while also learning about something I was <br> interested in.</p>

				<p id='cnep1'>Near the end of my grade 12 summer, I worked with the vendor Escar Entertainment at the BLC <br> foodtruck serving CNE visitors with roasted corn, fast food, freshly squeezed lemonade, and deep <br> fried chocolate treats.</p>

				<p id='cnep2'>Although I worked tiring 9 hour shifts, six days a week, working at the CNE was wonderful because it <br>helped me improve my customer service skills while allowing me to experience a fast-paced <br> working environment. I met many great new friends and really enjoyed working with all my <br> managers and coworkers at the CNE!</p>

				<p id='nofrillsp1'>My very first job was with Nick's No Frills as a cashier. I learned all the produce codes and helped <br> customers with checking out their groceries. It introduced me to customer service as well as <br> allowing me to experience handling money and more responsibilities.</p>

				<p id='nofrillsp2'>I resigned from No Frills in order to focus on my schoolwork in grade 12 and getting into University. <br> I truly treasure the opportunity I was given by Nick to experience my very first part-time job!</p>
