		    	<h1>Education</h1>

		    	<p>Born in Toronto, I was raise in a Chinese-Canadian household/ community and attended Dr. Norman Bethune C.I. where I <br> graduated as a Bethune Scholar in 2016. I began my undergraduate degree in Health Studies at the University of Waterloo in Fall <br> 2016 (graduating class of 2021), while also participating in various clubs such as Hyperloop and Velocity during my first year.</p>

			<h1>Career Aspirations</h1>

			<p>Short Term: My interest is in webpage design and/or diet related co-op positions, so I'm currently working towards landing a job <br> related to either/both fields!</p>

			<p>Long Term: I aspire to be an entrepreneur and one day start my own company by inventing a product or app that revolutionizes our <br> world, then pitching this idea at the
			<a href='http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/funding/velocity-fund/'>Velocity 25K Competition</a> held at the end of each University school term. Large goals such as <br> these are often difficult to attain, but I intend to work remarkably hard; one step at a time!</p>

			<h1>Technology and Web Development</h1>

			<p>My interest for web development began after my roommate introduced me to the idea of using computer science to design websites <br> and apps. I started learning how to code through online lessons, then by making this website. I'm currently fluent in HTML & CSS with <br> a good introduction to JQuery and Javascript.</p>

			<p>After seeing a job advertisement for <a href='https://hatchcanada.com/'>Hatch Canada</a>, I decided to give it a shot by applying and attending the group interview. This job <br> required no coding experience at all, as they said they would teach me all the Javascript I needed to know for the job.</p>

			<p>After being hired, I completed the online and in person training in two weeks and began teaching children Javascript through the P5JS <br> library that Hatch had on their website. It was a great experience that grew my interest for coding for the present and future!</p>

			<h1>Interests & Hobbies</h1>

			<p>Throughout my childhood I loved sports and being active. I enjoyed playing and learning all the different sports in Phys-ed class and <br> with my friends. It seems that everytime I hungout with my friends, all we did was play one sport or another. </p>

			<p>I had a brief stint with baseball when I was 6, then moved on to rep soccer at 14. After a few years in soccer, I realized it wasn't for me <br> and I focused more on Ultimate Frisbee, a sport I began playing in grade 8.</p>

			<p>In my senior year of high school, I captained our frisbee team and we finished as city finalists. After realizing how much fun it was <br> playing alongside my friends and teammates, a few friends and I tried out for the Toronto Elites program, and we were placed on the <br> Toronto B Team, Uproar. We competed at the Nationals tournament in Edmonton and finished 9th in the country. However, frisbee <br> hasn't stopped for me as I'm still currently playing on the UWaterloo Ultimate Frisbee squad!</p>
